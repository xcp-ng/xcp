## What is XCP-ng ?

XCP-ng is a virtualization platform based on **Xen Source** and **CitrixÂ® Hypervisor** (formerly XenServer).
XCP-ng stands for **Xen Cloud Platform - New Generation** and is an *hommage* to the old Open Source project XCP that was ditched when XenServer became Open Sourced in 2013. 

### Genesis 

* 2003 : Xen project birth, first open source hypervisor
* 2007 : Xen Source Inc. acquired by Citrix, birth of XenServer (closed source) 
* 2010 : Citrix strategy focused on virtual desktop (XenApp/XenDesktop) instead of servers virtualization
* 2011 : XCP 1.0 (Xen Cloud Platform, Open Source XenServer)
* 2013 : XenServer become Open (end of XCP). Birth of Xen Orchestra
* 2017 (dec.) : Citrix changes it's pricing strategy regarding XenServer and remove essential features from free XenServer version. New features developed are (mostly) not open source anymore
* 2018 (janv) : XenServer fork,  birth of XCP-ng
* 2019 (Jul.): XCP-ng 8.0 is released
