GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

   Version 2, June 1991

   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,
   USA

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
   copies of this license document, but changing it is
   not allowed.

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away
   your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
   GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
   freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
   the software is free for all its users. This General
   Public License applies to most of the Free Software
   Foundation's software and to any other program whose
   authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
   Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser
   General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
   your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to
   freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
   designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
   distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   this service if you wish), that you receive source
   code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
   the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
   that forbid anyone to deny  you  these  rights  or to
   ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
   translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
   distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a
   program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give
   the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
   make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. And you must show them these terms so they know
   their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright
   the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
   you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
   the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
   make certain that everyone understands that there is
   no warranty for this free software. If the  software
   is  modified by someone else and passed on, we want
   its recipients to know that what they have is not the
   original, so that any problems introduced by others
   will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
   by software patents. We wish  to  avoid  the danger
   that redistributors of a free program will individually
   obtain  patent  licenses,  in  effect making the program
   proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
   that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
   use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying,
   distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work
    which contains a
       notice placed by the copyright holder saying
       it may be distributed under the terms of this
       General Public License. The "Program", below,
       refers to any such program or work, and a "work
       based on the Program" means either the Program or
       any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
       say,  a work containing the Program or a portion of
       it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
       translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
       translation is included without limitation in the
       term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
       "you".  Activities other than copying, distribution
       and modification are not covered by this License;
       they are outside its scope. The act of running the
       Program is not restricted, and the output from the
       Program is covered only if its contents constitute
       a work based on the Program (independent of having
       been made by running the Program). Whether that is
       true depends on what the Program does.
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
    Program's source code
       as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
       conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
       an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
       warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
       this License  and  to  the  absence of any warranty;
       and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
       of this License along with the Program.  You may
       charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
       a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
       protection in exchange for a fee.
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program
    or any portion of it,
       thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy
       and distribute such modifications or work under
       the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
       also meet all of these conditions:
         a. You  must cause the modified files to carry
         prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the
            date of any change.
         b. You must cause any work that you distribute
         or publish, that in
            whole or in part contains or is derived from
            the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
            as a whole at no charge to all third parties
            under the terms of this License.
         c. If the modified program normally reads commands
         interactively when
            run, you must cause it, when started running
            for such interactive use in the most ordinary
            way, to print or display an announcement
            including an appropriate copyright notice and
            a notice that there is no warranty (or else,
            saying that you provide a warranty) and that
            users may redistribute the program under
            these conditions, and telling the user how
            to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
            if the Program itself is interactive but does
            not normally print such an announcement, your
            work based on the Program is not required to
            print an announcement.)
       These  requirements  apply  to  the  modified
       work as a whole. If identifiable sections of
       that work are not derived from the Program, and
       can  be  reasonably  considered  independent and
       separate works in themselves, then this License,
       and its terms, do not apply to those sections
       when you distribute them as separate works. But
       when you distribute the same sections as part of
       a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
       distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees
       extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and
       every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it
       is not the intent of this section to claim rights
       or contest your rights to work written entirely
       by you; rather, the intent is to exercise  the
       right  to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Program.  In addition,
       mere aggregation of another work not based on
       the Program with the Program (or with a work
       based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
       distribution medium does not bring the other work
       under the scope of this License.
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
    based on it, under
       Section 2) in object code or executable form under
       the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
       you also do one of the following:
         a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
         machine-readable
            source code, which must be distributed under
            the terms of Sections 1  and  2  above  on
            a  medium customarily used for software
            interchange; or,
         b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for
         at least three years,
            to give any third party, for a charge no more
            than your cost of physically   performing
            source   distribution,  a  complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding
            source code, to be distributed under the
            terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,
         c. Accompany it with the information you received
         as to the offer to
            distribute corresponding source code. (This
            alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
            distribution and only if you received the
            program in object code or executable form
            with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
            b above.)
       The source code for a work means the preferred form
       of the work for making modifications to it. For an
       executable work, complete source code means  all
       the  source code for all modules it contains, plus
       any associated interface definition files, plus the
       scripts used to control compilation and installation
       of the executable. However, as a special exception,
       the source code distributed need not include
       anything that is normally distributed (in either
       source or binary form) with the major components
       (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
       system on which the executable runs, unless
       that component itself accompanies the executable.
       If distribution of executable or object code is made
       by offering access to copy from a designated place,
       then offering equivalent access to copy the source
       code from the same place counts as distribution
       of the source code, even though third parties are
       not compelled to copy the source along with the
       object code.
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
    the Program except
       as expressly provided under this License. Any
       attempt otherwise to copy, modify,  sublicense
       or  distribute  the Program is void, and will
       automatically terminate your rights under this
       License. However, parties who have received copies,
       or rights, from you under this License will not
       have their licenses terminated so long as such
       parties remain in full compliance.
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since
    you have not signed
       it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
       modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
       works. These actions are prohibited by law if
       you  do  not  accept  this License. Therefore,
       by modifying or distributing  the  Program (or
       any work based on the Program), you indicate your
       acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
       terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
       modifying the Program or works based on it.
    6. Each  time  you redistribute the Program (or any
    work based on the
       Program),  the recipient automatically receives
       a license from the original licensor to copy,
       distribute or modify the Program subject to these
       terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
       rights granted herein. You are not responsible
       for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
       License.
    7. If,  as  a consequence of a court judgment or
    allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited
       to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
       (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
       that contradict the conditions of this License,
       they do not excuse you from the conditions of
       this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
       satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
       this License and any other pertinent obligations,
       then as a consequence you may not distribute the
       Program at all. For example, if a patent license
       would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
       Program by all those who receive copies directly
       or indirectly through you, then the only way you
       could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
       If any portion of this section is held invalid or
       unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
       the balance of the section is intended to apply  and
       the  section  as a whole is intended to apply in
       other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this
       section to induce you to infringe any patents or
       other property right claims or to contest validity
       of any such  claims;  this section has the sole
       purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
       software distribution system, which is implemented
       by  public  license  practices.  Many  people  have
       made generous contributions to the wide range of
       software distributed through that system in reliance
       on consistent application of that system; it is up
       to the  author/donor  to decide if he or she is
       willing to distribute software through any other
       system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear
       what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
       of this License.
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
    restricted in certain
       countries either by patents or by copyrighted
       interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
       the Program under this License may add an explicit
       geographical distribution limitation excluding those
       countries, so that distribution is permitted only
       in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
       case, this License incorporates the limitation as
       if written in the body of this License.
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
    and/or new versions of
       the General Public License from time to time. Such
       new versions will be similar in spirit to the
       present version, but may differ in detail to address
       new problems or concerns.  Each version is given
       a distinguishing version number. If the Program
       specifies a version number of this License which
       applies to it and "any later  version",  you  have
       the option of following the terms and conditions
       either of that version or of any later version
       published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
       Program does not specify a version number of this
       License, you may choose any version ever published
       by the Free Software Foundation.
   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program
   into other free programs
       whose distribution conditions are different,
       write to the author to ask for permission. For
       software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
       Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
       we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
       will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
       free status of all derivatives of our free software
       and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
       generally.

NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
       THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
       LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
       COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE  THE
       PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
       EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
       TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
       FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
       AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
       IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
       YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
   AGREED TO IN WRITING
       WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
       MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE  THE PROGRAM AS
       PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
       INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  ARISING  OUT  OF  THE USE
       OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING  BUT
       NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
       INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
       PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
       WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
       OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
       SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   To do so, attach the following notices to the
   program. It is safest to attach them to the start
   of each source file to most effectively convey the
   exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
   least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the
   full notice is found.

   one line to give the program's name and an idea of what
   it does.

   Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it
   and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will
   be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
   implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General
   Public License along with this program; if not, write to
   the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
   Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
   and paper mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short
   notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for
   details type 'show w'.  This is free software, and you
   are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
   type 'show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c'
   should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
   License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
   something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could
   even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits
   your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work
   as a programmer) or your school,  if  any, to
   sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
   in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
   compilers) written by James Hacker.

   This General Public License does not permit
   incorporating your program into proprietary
   programs. If your program is a subroutine library,
   you may consider it more useful to permit linking
   proprietary applications with the library. If this is
   what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
   License instead of this License.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

   Version 2.1, February 1999

   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
   USA

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
   copies of this license document, but changing it is
   not allowed.

   [This is the first released version of the Lesser
   GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library
   Public License, version 2, hence the version number
   2.1.]

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away
   your freedom to share  and change it. By contrast, the
   GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
   your freedom to share and change free software--to make
   sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License,
   applies to some specially designated software
   packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
   Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
   about whether this license or the ordinary  General
   Public License is the better strategy to use in any
   particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to
   freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses
   are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
   distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish); that you receive source code or
   can get it if you want it;  that you can change the
   software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you are informed that you can do these things.

   To  protect  your  rights,  we  need  to make
   restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these
   rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you
   modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library,
   whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
   recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
   make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. If you link other code with the library, you must
   provide complete object files to the recipients, so
   that they can relink them with the library after making
   changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
   show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1)
   we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this
   license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
   distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it
   very clear that there is no warranty for the free
   library. Also, if the library is modified by someone
   else and passed on, the recipients should know that
   what they have is not the original version, so that
   the original author's reputation will not be affected
   by problems that might be introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the
   existence of any free  program.  We wish to make sure
   that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of
   a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from
   a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
   license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in
   this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered
   by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This
   license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies
   to certain designated libraries, and is quite different
   from the ordinary General Public License. We use this
   license for certain libraries in order to permit linking
   those libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether
   statically or using a shared library, the combination
   of the two is legally speaking a combined work,
   a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking
   only if the entire combination fits its criteria of
   freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more
   lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License
   because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than
   the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides
   other free software developers Less of an advantage over
   competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are
   the reason we use the ordinary General Public License
   for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
   advantages in certain special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special
   need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
   library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To
   achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to
   use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free
   libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
   limiting  the free library to free software only,
   so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library
   in non-free programs enables a greater number of people
   to use a large body of free software. For example,
   permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs
   enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
   system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less
   protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that
   the user of a program that is linked with the Library
   has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
   using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying,
   distribution and modification follow. Pay close
   attention to the difference between a "work based on
   the library"  and a "work that uses the library". The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas
   the latter must be combined with the library in order
   to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License Agreement applies to any software
    library or other program
       which  contains  a  notice placed by the copyright
       holder or other authorized party saying it may be
       distributed under the terms of this Lesser  General
       Public License (also called "this License"). Each
       licensee is addressed as "you".  A  "library"
       means a collection of software functions and/or
       data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
       with application programs (which use some of
       those functions and data) to form executables.
       The "Library", below, refers to any such software
       library or work which has been distributed under
       these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
       either the Library or any derivative work under
       copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
       Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
       modifications and/or translated straightforwardly
       into another  language.  (Hereinafter,  translation
       is included without limitation in the term
       "modification".)  "Source code" for a work means the
       preferred form of the work for making modifications
       to it. For a library, complete source code means
       all the source code for all modules it contains,
       plus any associated interface definition files,
       plus the scripts used to control compilation and
       installation of the library.  Activities other
       than copying, distribution and modification are
       not covered by this License; they are outside
       its scope. The act of running a program using the
       Library is not restricted, and output from such a
       program is covered only if its contents constitute
       a work based on the Library (independent of the use
       of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
       that is true depends on what the Library does and
       what the program that uses the Library does.
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
    Library's complete
       source  code  as  you receive it, in any medium,
       provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
       publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
       notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
       the notices that refer to this License and to the
       absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of
       this License along with the Library.  You may charge
       a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
       and you may at your option offer warranty protection
       in exchange for a fee.
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library
    or any portion of it,
       thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy
       and distribute such modifications or work under
       the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
       also meet all of these conditions:
         a. The modified work must itself be a software
         library.  b. You  must cause the files modified
         to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the
            date of any change.
         c. You must cause the whole of the work to be
         licensed at no charge to
            all third parties under the terms of this
            License.
         d. If a facility in the modified Library refers
         to a function or a
            table of data to be supplied by an application
            program that uses the facility, other than
            as an argument passed when the facility is
            invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
            to ensure that, in the event an application
            does not supply such function or table, the
            facility still operates, and performs whatever
            part of its purpose remains meaningful.
            (For example, a function in a library to
            compute square roots has a purpose  that
            is  entirely  well-defined  independent of
            the application.  Therefore,  Subsection
            2d  requires  that  any application-supplied
            function or table used by this function must
            be optional: if the application does not supply
            it, the square root function must still compute
            square roots.)  These  requirements apply to
            the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
            sections  of that work are not derived from
            the Library, and can be reasonably considered
            independent and separate works in themselves,
            then this License, and its terms, do not apply
            to those sections when you distribute them as
            separate works. But when you distribute the
            same sections as part of a whole which is a
            work based on the Library, the distribution
            of the whole must be on the terms of this
            License, whose permissions for other licensees
            extend  to  the entire whole, and thus to each
            and every part regardless of who wrote it.
            Thus, it is not the intent of this section
            to claim rights or contest your rights to
            work written entirely by you; rather, the
            intent is to exercise the right to control
            the distribution of derivative or collective
            works based on the Library.  In addition,
            mere aggregation of another work not based
            on the Library with the Library (or with a
            work based on the Library) on a volume of a
            storage or distribution medium does not bring
            the other work under the scope of this License.
    3. You  may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary
    GNU General Public
       License instead of this License to a given copy of
       the Library. To do this, you must alter all the
       notices that refer to this License, so that they
       refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
       version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer
       version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
       Public License has appeared, then you can specify
       that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
       other change in these notices.  Once this change is
       made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
       copy,  so  the  ordinary GNU General Public License
       applies to all subsequent copies and derivative
       works made from that copy.  This option is useful
       when you wish to copy part of the code of the
       Library into a program that is not a library.
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a
    portion or derivative of
       it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
       form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above
       provided that you accompany it with the complete
       corresponding machine-readable source code,
       which must be distributed  under the terms of
       Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
       used for software interchange.  If distribution
       of object code is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, then offering equivalent
       access to copy the source code from the same place
       satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
       code, even though third parties are not compelled
       to copy the source along with the object code.
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion
    of the Library, but
       is designed to work with the Library by being
       compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that
       uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
       is not a derivative work of the Library, and
       therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
       However, linking a "work that uses the Library"
       with the Library creates an executable that is
       a derivative of the Library (because it contains
       portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
       uses the library".  The executable is therefore
       covered by this License. Section 6 states terms
       for distribution of such executables.  When a
       "work that uses the Library" uses material from
       a header file that is part of the Library, the
       object code for the work may be a derivative work
       of the Library even though the source code is not.
       Whether this is true is especially significant if
       the work can be linked without the Library, or if
       the work is itself a library. The threshold for this
       to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such
       an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
       structure layouts and accessors, and small macros
       and small inline functions (ten lines  or  less
       in  length),  then  the use of the object file is
       unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
       a derivative work.  (Executables containing this
       object code plus portions of the Library will still
       fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise,  if  the  work
       is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
       the object code for the work under the terms of
       Section 6.  Any executables containing that work
       also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
       linked directly with the Library itself.
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also
    combine or link a
       "work  that  uses  the Library" with the Library to
       produce a work containing portions of the Library,
       and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
       provided that the terms permit modification of
       the work for the customer's own use and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications.
       You must give prominent notice with each copy of
       the work that the Library is used in it and that the
       Library and its use are covered by this License. You
       must supply a copy of this License. If the work
       during execution displays copyright notices, you
       must include the copyright notice for the Library
       among them, as well as a reference directing the
       user to the copy of this License. Also, you must
       do one of these things:
         a. Accompany the work with the complete
         corresponding machine-readable
            source code for the Library including whatever
            changes were used in the work (which must be
            distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,
            if the work is an executable linked with the
            Library, with the complete machine-readable
            "work that uses the Library", as object code
            and/or source code, so that the user can
            modify the Library and then relink to produce
            a modified executable containing the modified
            Library. (It is understood that the user who
            changes the contents of definitions files in
            the Library will not necessarily be  able
            to  recompile  the  application to use the
            modified definitions.)
         b. Use  a suitable shared library mechanism for
         linking with the
            Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
            (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
            already present on the user's computer system,
            rather than copying library functions into the
            executable, and (2) will operate properly with
            a modified version of the library, if the  user
            installs  one,  as long as the modified version
            is interface-compatible with the version that
            the work was made with.
         c. Accompany the work with a written offer,
         valid for at least three
            years, to give the same user the materials
            specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
            charge no more than the cost of performing
            this distribution.
         d. If distribution of the work is made by offering
         access to copy from
            a designated place, offer equivalent access
            to copy the above specified materials from
            the same place.
         e. Verify that the user has already received a
         copy of these materials
            or that you have already sent this user a copy.
       For an executable, the required form of the "work
       that uses the Library" must include any data
       and utility programs needed for reproducing the
       executable from it. However, as a special exception,
       the materials to be distributed need not include
       anything that is normally distributed (in either
       source or binary form) with the major components
       (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
       system on which the executable runs, unless that
       component itself accompanies the executable.  It may
       happen that this requirement contradicts the license
       restrictions of  other proprietary libraries that do
       not normally accompany the operating system. Such
       a contradiction means you cannot use both them
       and the Library together in an executable that
       you distribute.
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work
    based on the Library
       side-by-side in a single library together with other
       library facilities not covered by this License,
       and distribute such a combined library, provided
       that the separate distribution of the work based
       on the Library and of the other library facilities
       is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
       these two things:
         a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of
         the same work based
            on the Library, uncombined with any other
            library facilities. This must be distributed
            under the terms of the Sections above.
         b. Give prominent notice with the combined library
         of the fact that
            part of it is a work based on the Library,
            and explaining where to find the accompanying
            uncombined form of the same work.
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
    or distribute the
       Library except as expressly provided under this
       License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
       sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
       is void, and will automatically terminate your
       rights under this License. However, parties who
       have received copies, or rights, from you under this
       License will not have their licenses terminated so
       long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since
    you have not signed
       it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
       modify or distribute the Library or its derivative
       works. These actions are prohibited by law if
       you  do  not  accept  this License. Therefore,
       by modifying or distributing  the  Library (or
       any work based on the Library), you indicate your
       acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
       terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
       modifying the Library or works based on it.
   10. Each  time  you redistribute the Library (or any
   work based on the
       Library),  the recipient automatically receives
       a license from the original licensor to copy,
       distribute, link with or modify the Library
       subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
       impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
       exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are
       not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
       parties with this License.
   11. If,  as  a consequence of a court judgment or
   allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited
       to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
       (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
       that contradict the conditions of this License,
       they do not excuse you from the conditions of
       this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
       satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
       this License and any other pertinent obligations,
       then as a consequence you may not distribute the
       Library at all. For example, if a patent license
       would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
       Library by all those who receive copies directly
       or indirectly through you, then the only way you
       could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
       If any portion of this section is held invalid or
       unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
       the balance of the section is intended to apply,
       and  the  section as a whole is intended to apply in
       other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this
       section to induce you to infringe any patents or
       other property right claims or to contest validity
       of any such  claims;  this section has the sole
       purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
       software distribution system which is implemented
       by  public  license  practices.  Many  people  have
       made generous contributions to the wide range of
       software distributed through that system in reliance
       on consistent application of that system; it is up
       to the  author/donor  to decide if he or she is
       willing to distribute software through any other
       system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear
       what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
       of this License.
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is
   restricted in certain
       countries either by patents or by copyrighted
       interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
       the Library under this License may add an explicit
       geographical distribution limitation excluding those
       countries, so that distribution is permitted only
       in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
       case, this License incorporates the limitation as
       if written in the body of this License.
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
   and/or new versions of
       the Lesser General Public License from time
       to time. Such new versions will be similar in
       spirit to the present version, but may differ
       in detail to address new problems or concerns.
       Each version is given a distinguishing version
       number. If the Library specifies a version number
       of this License which applies to it and "any later
       version",  you  have  the option of following the
       terms and conditions either of that version or of
       any later version published by the Free Software
       Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
       license version number, you may choose any version
       ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library
   into other free programs
       whose distribution conditions are incompatible
       with these, write to the author to ask for
       permission. For software which is copyrighted by
       the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
       Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
       for this. Our decision will be guided by the
       two goals of preserving the free status of all
       derivatives of our free software and of promoting
       the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
       THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
       LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
       COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE  THE
       LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
       EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
       TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
       FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
       AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY
       IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
       YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
   AGREED TO IN WRITING
       WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
       MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE  THE LIBRARY AS
       PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
       INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  ARISING  OUT  OF  THE USE
       OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING  BUT
       NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
       INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
       PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE
       WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
       OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
       SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of
   the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
   making it free software that everyone can redistribute
   and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
   under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
   of the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to
   the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
   of each source file to most effectively convey the
   exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
   least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the
   full notice is found.

   one line to give the program's name and an idea of what
   it does.

   Copyright (C) year name of author

   This library is free software; you can redistribute
   it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License as published by the Free Software
   Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will
   be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
   implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
   License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License along with this library; if not,
   write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
   Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
   and paper mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work
   as a programmer) or your school,  if  any, to
   sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
   in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs)
   written by James Random Hacker.

   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

   That's all there is to it!

The Academic Free License v. 2.1

   This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to
   any original work of authorship (the "Original Work")
   whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following
   notice immediately following the copyright notice for
   the Original Work:

   Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
    1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants
    You a world-wide,
       royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
       sublicenseable license to do the following:
         a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
         b. to prepare derivative works ("Derivative
         Works") based upon the
            Original Work;
         c. to distribute copies of the Original Work and
         Derivative Works to
            the public;
         d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and
         e. to display the Original Work publicly.
    2. Grant  of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants
    You a world-wide,
       royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
       sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned
       or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied
       in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor,
       to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original
       Work and Derivative Works.
    3. Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code"
    means the preferred
       form  of  the Original Work for making modifications
       to it and all available documentation describing
       how to modify the Original Work.  Licensor hereby
       agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of
       the Source Code of the Original Work along with
       each copy of the Original Work that Licensor
       distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
       this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy
       of the Source Code in an information repository
       reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
       convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
       continues to distribute the Original Work, and
       by publishing the address of that information
       repository in a notice immediately following the
       copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
    4. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names
    of Licensor, nor the
       names  of  any contributors to the Original Work,
       nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may
       be used to endorse or promote products derived
       from this Original Work without express prior
       written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in
       this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to
       trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
       any other intellectual property of Licensor except
       as expressly stated herein. No patent  license
       is  granted  to  make, use, sell or offer to sell
       embodiments of any patent claims other than the
       licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is
       granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such
       marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
       in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
       Licensor from licensing under different terms
       from this License any Original Work that Licensor
       otherwise would have a right to license.
    5. This section intentionally omitted.  6. Attribution
    Rights.  You  must  retain, in the Source Code of any
       Derivative Works that You create, all copyright,
       patent or trademark notices  from the Source Code
       of the Original Work, as well as any notices of
       licensing and any descriptive text identified
       therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
       the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You
       create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
       reasonably calculated to inform recipients that
       You have modified the Original Work.
    7. Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of
    Warranty. Licensor warrants
       that the copyright in and to the Original Work and
       the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are
       owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to  You
       under the terms of this License with the permission
       of the contributor(s)  of  those  copyrights and
       patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the
       immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work
       is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
       and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
       including, without limitation, the warranties  of
       NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
       A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
       QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
       DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No license to Original Work
       is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
    8. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances
    and under no legal
       theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
       contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be
       liable to any person for any direct, indirect,
       special, incidental, or consequential damages of
       any character arising as a result of this License
       or the use of the Original Work including, without
       limitation,  damages for loss of goodwill, work
       stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
       and all other commercial damages or losses. This
       limitation of liability shall not apply to
       liability for death or personal injury resulting
       from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable
       law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
       not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental
       or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
       limitation may not apply to You.
    9. Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies
    of the Original
       Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a
       reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
       the express assent of recipients to the terms of
       this  License.  Nothing  else but this License
       (or another written agreement between Licensor and
       You) grants You permission to create Derivative
       Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise
       any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein,
       and any attempt to do so except under the terms
       of this License (or another written agreement
       between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
       U.S. copyright law, the equivalent  laws  of other
       countries, and by international treaty.  Therefore,
       by exercising any of the rights granted to You in
       Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of
       this License and all of its terms and conditions.
   10. Termination  for  Patent  Action.  This  License
   shall  terminate
       automatically and You may no longer exercise any
       of the rights granted to You by this License as
       of the date You commence an action, including
       a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor
       or any licensee alleging that the Original Work
       infringes a patent. This termination provision
       shall  not  apply  for  an  action alleging patent
       infringement by combinations of the Original Work
       with other software or hardware.
   11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action
   or suit relating to
       this License may be brought only in the courts
       of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or
       in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
       and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding
       its conflict-of-law provisions.  The  application
       of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
       for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
       excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside
       the scope of this License or after its termination
       shall be subject to the requirements and penalties
       of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 101
       et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries,
       and international treaty. This section shall survive
       the termination of this License.
   12. Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms
   of this License or
       seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing
       party shall be entitled to  recover its costs and
       expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
       attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection
       with such action, including any appeal of such
       action. This section shall survive the termination
       of this License.
   13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete
   agreement concerning
       the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
       License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
       shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
       make it enforceable.
   14. Definition of "You" in This License. "You"
   throughout this License,
       whether in upper or lower case, means an
       individual or a legal entity exercising rights
       under, and complying with all of the terms of,
       this License. For legal entities, "You" includes
       any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
       under common control with you. For purposes of
       this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
       direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
       management of such entity, whether by contract
       or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
       (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
       beneficial ownership of such entity.
   15. Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all
   ways not otherwise
       restricted  or conditioned by this License or by
       law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with
       or be responsible for such uses by You.

   This  license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence
   E. Rosen. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby
   granted to copy and distribute this license without
   modification. This license may not be modified without
   the express written permission of its copyright owner.

       the Appendix below).  "Derivative Works" shall mean
       any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
       based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
       the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations,
       or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
       original work of authorship. For the purposes of
       this License, Derivative Works shall not include
       works that remain separable from, or merely link
       (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work
       and Derivative Works thereof.  "Contribution" shall
       mean any work of authorship, including the original
       version of the Work and any modifications or

       and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
       or on behalf of, the Licensor for the  purpose  of

       behalf  of  whom  a Contribution has been received
       by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within
       the Work.
    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms
    and conditions of this
       License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
       perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
       royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
       to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
       and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
       in Source or Object form.
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of this
       License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
       perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
       royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
       this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell,  import, and otherwise
       transfer the Work, where such license applies
       only to those patent claims licensable by such
       Contributor that are  necessarily  infringed  by
       their Contribution(s) alone or by combination  of
       their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
       Contribution(s)  was submitted. If You institute
       patent litigation against  any  entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
       that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
       the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
       infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
       You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute
    copies of the Work or
       Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or
       without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
       provided that You meet the following conditions:
         a. You must give any other recipients of the Work
         or Derivative Works
            a copy of this License; and
         b. You  must cause any modified files to carry
         prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
         c. You must retain, in the Source form of any
         Derivative Works that
            You distribute, all copyright, patent,
            trademark, and attribution notices from the
            Source form of the Work, excluding those
            notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
         d. If  the  Work  includes  a  "NOTICE" text file
         as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works
            that You distribute must include a readable
            copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those
            notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
            following places:  within a NOTICE text file
            distributed as part of the Derivative Works;
            within the Source form or documentation, if
            provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative
            Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
            normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE
            file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your
            own attribution notices within Derivative
            Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
            addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
            provided that such additional attribution
            notices cannot be construed as modifying
            the License.  You may add Your own copyright
            statement to Your modifications and may
            provide additional or different license
            terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            or distribution of Your modifications, or for
            any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
            Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
            the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
            stated in this License.
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise, any
       Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
       in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
       the terms and conditions of this License, without
       any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
       the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you
       may have executed with Licensor regarding such
       Contributions.
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
       of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable
       and customary use in describing the origin of the
       Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by
    applicable law or agreed to
       in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS
       IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, either express or implied, including, without
       limitation, any   warranties   or   conditions
       of  TITLE,  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
       FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely

OpenSSH License

   The licenses which components of this software fall
   under are as follows.  First,  we  will summarize and
   say that all components are under a BSD license, or a
   license more free than that.

   OpenSSH contains no GPL code.
    1. Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen (ylo@cs.hut.fi),
    Espoo, Finland
       All rights reserved As far as I am concerned,
       the code I have written for this software can be
       used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions
       of this software must be clearly marked as such,
       and if the derived work is incompatible with the
       protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
       called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
       [Tatu continues] However,  I am not implying to give
       any licenses to any patents or copyrights held by
       third parties, and the software includes parts that
       are not under my direct control. As far as I know,
       all included source code is used in accordance with
       the relevant license agreements and can be  used
       freely  for  any purpose (the GNU license being
       the most restrictive); see below for details.
       [However, none of that term is relevant at this
       point in time. All of these restrictively licensed
       software components which he talks about have been
       removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,
          + RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL
          library + IDEA is no longer included, its use is
          deprecated + DES is now external, in the OpenSSL
          library + GMP is no longer used, and instead we
          call BN code from OpenSSL + Zlib is now external,
          in a library + The make-ssh-known-hosts script
          is no longer included + TSS has been removed +
          MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library +
          RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support
          from OpenSSL + Blowfish is now external, in the
          OpenSSL library
       [The license continues] Note that any information
       and cryptographic algorithms used in this software
       are  publicly available on the Internet and at any
       major bookstore,  scientific  library, and patent
       office worldwide. More information can be found
       e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".  The  legal
       status of this program is some combination of all
       these permissions and restrictions. Use only at
       your own responsibility. You will be responsible
       for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
       making any claims whether possessing or using
       this is legal or not in your country, and I am
       not taking any responsibility on your behalf.
       NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE
       OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
       TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
       WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
       HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE  THE  PROGRAM
       "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

       AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
       IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
       YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
       REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED
       BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
       COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
       AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
       ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
       ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
       DAMAGES  ARISING  OUT  OF  THE USE OR INABILITY TO

       OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
       SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

       EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
       OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The "Artistic License"

Preamble

   The intent of this document is to state the conditions
   under which a Package may be copied, such that
   the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
   artistic control over the development of the package,
   while giving the users of the package the right to
   use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
   customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
   modifications.

Definitions:

   "Package" refers to the collection of files
   distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives
   of that collection of files created through textual
   modification.  "Standard Version" refers to such
   a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
   modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
   Holder as specified below.  "Copyright Holder" is
   whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
   package.  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying
   or distributing this Package.  "Reasonable copying
   fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
   cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
   and so on. (You will not be required to justify it
   to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
   community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for
   the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
   handling the item. It also means that recipients of the
   item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
   received it.
    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the
    source form of the
       Standard Version of this Package without
       restriction, provided that you duplicate  all  of
       the  original copyright notices and associated
       disclaimers.
    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and
    other modifications
       derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
       Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall
       still be considered the Standard Version.
    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package
    in any way, provided
       that you insert a prominent notice in each changed
       file stating how and when you changed that file, and
       provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
         a. place your modifications in the Public Domain
         or otherwise make
            them Freely Available, such as by posting
            said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
            medium, or placing the modifications on a
            major  archive  site such as uunet.uu.net,
            or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
            your modifications in the Standard Version of
            the Package.
         b. use  the  modified  Package  only  within your
         corporation or
            organization.
         c. rename any non-standard executables so the
         names do not conflict
            with standard executables, which must also
            be provided, and provide a  separate manual
            page for each non-standard executable that
            clearly documents how it differs from the
            Standard Version.
         d. make other distribution arrangements with the
         Copyright Holder.
    4. You  may distribute the programs of this Package
    in object code or
       executable form, provided that you do at least ONE
       of the following:
         a. distribute a Standard Version of the
         executables and library files,
            together with instructions (in the manual page
            or equivalent) on where to get the Standard
            Version.
         b. accompany the distribution with the
         machine-readable source of the
            Package with your modifications.
         c. give non-standard executables non-standard
         names, and clearly
            document the differences in manual pages
            (or equivalent), together with instructions
            on where to get the Standard Version.
         d. make other distribution arrangements with the
         Copyright Holder.
    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any
    distribution of this
       Package. You may charge any fee you choose for
       support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee
       for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
       this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
       commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
       commercial) software distribution provided that
       you do not advertise this Package as a product of
       your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter
       within an executable of yours  (by  linking);  this
       shall  be construed as a mere form of aggregation,
       provided  that  the complete Standard Version of
       the interpreter is so embedded.
    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to
    or produced as output
       from the programs of this Package do not
       automatically fall under the copyright of this
       Package, but belong to whomever generated them,
       and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated
       with this Package. If such scripts or library files
       are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
       "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary
       executable image, then distribution of such an image
       shall neither be construed as a distribution of this
       Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
       of  Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not
       represent such an executable image as a Standard
       Version of this Package.
    7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines
    in other languages)
       supplied  by  you and linked into this Package
       in order to emulate subroutines and variables of
       the language defined by this Package shall not
       be considered part of this Package, but are the
       equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided
       these subroutines do not change the language in
       any way that would cause it to fail the regression
       tests for the language.
    8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial
    distribution is always
       permitted provided that the use of this Package is
       embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to
       make this Package's interfaces visible to the end
       user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall
       not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
    9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used
    to endorse or promote
       products derived from this software without specific
       prior written permission.
   10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
       WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS
       FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Python

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE

   Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van
   Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see
   http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of
   a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal
   author, although it includes many contributions from
   others.

   In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the
   Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI,
   see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia
   where he released several versions of the software.

   In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team
   moved to BeOpen.com to  form  the BeOpen PythonLabs
   team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
   team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation,
   see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software
   Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was
   formed, a non-profit organization created specifically
   to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope
   Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

   All Python releases are Open Source (see
   http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source
   Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python
   releases have  also been GPL-compatible; the table
   below summarizes the various releases.

   2.4.2          2.4.1        2005      PSF        yes

   Footnotes:
    1. GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing
    Python under the
       GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you
       distribute a modified version without making your
       changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses
       make it possible to combine Python with other
       software that is released under the GPL; the
       others don't.
    2. According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not
    GPL-compatible, because its
       license  has  a  choice of law clause. According
       to CNRI, however, Stallman's  lawyer  has  told
       CNRI's  lawyer  that  1.6.1 is "not incompatible"
       with the GPL.

   Thanks  to  the  many outside volunteers who have worked
   under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.

   non-exclusive license, subject to third party
   intellectual property claims:

   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
   patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer

   and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof)
   with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a
   Larger Work; and

   (b)  under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using

   practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise
   dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).

   (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first
   distributes Original Code under the terms of this
   License.

   (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent
   license is granted: 1) for  code that You delete from
   the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;
   or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification
   of the Original  Code  or ii) the combination of the
   Original Code with other software or devices.

   2.2 Contributor Grant. Subject to third party
   intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby
   grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
   license

   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
   patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use,
   reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and

   dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor
   (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
   Modifications made by that Contributor with its

   that Contributor with other software (except as part
   of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4)
   under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
   absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

   3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which
   You create or to which You contribute are governed by
   the terms of this License, including without limitation
   Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
   be distributed only under the terms of this License or
   a future version of this License released under Section
   6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
   every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
   not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
   that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
   License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  However,
   You may include an additional document offering the
   additional rights described in Section 3.5.

   3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
   which You create or to which You contribute must be
   made available in Source Code form under the terms of
   this License either on the same media as an Executable
   version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
   Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an  Executable
   version available; and if made available via Electronic
   Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at
   least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
   became available, or at least six (6) months after
   a subsequent version of that particular Modification
   has been made available to such recipients. You are
   responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
   remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
   Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all
   Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
   documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
   Code and the date of any change. You must include a
   prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
   directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided
   by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
   Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
   notice in an Executable version or related documentation
   in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
   Covered Code.

   3.4 Intellectual Property Matters.

   (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual
   knowledge that a license under a third party's
   intellectual property rights is required to exercise
   the  rights  granted  by  such  Contributor under
   Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text
   file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL"
   which describes the claim and the party making the claim
   in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
   contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
   Modification is made available as described in Section
   3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file
   in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.

   (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications
   include an application programming  interface  and
   Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses
   which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
   Contributor must also include this information in the
   LEGAL file.

   (c)  Representations. Contributor represents that,
   except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
   above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
   Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
   and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
   rights conveyed by this License.

   3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice
   in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is
   not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
   Code file due to its structure, then You must include
   such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
   where a user would be most  likely  to  look  for  such
   a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
   You  may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
   described  in  Exhibit  A. You must also duplicate this
   License in any documentation for the Source Code where
   You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
   relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,
   and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
   or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
   Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
   behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
   any Contributor.  You must make it absolutely clear
   that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
   obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
   agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
   Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability
   arising from intellectual property claims relating to
   the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer
   or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
   distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
   the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
   that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
   that the Source Code  version of the Covered Code is
   available under the terms of this License, including
   a description of how and where You have fulfilled
   the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be
   conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
   version, related documentation or collateral in which
   You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
   Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
   Covered Code or ownership rights under a  license of
   Your choice, which may contain terms different from
   this License, provided that You are in compliance with
   the terms of this License and that the license for the
   Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter
   the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
   the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
   the Executable version under a different license You
   must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
   differ  from this License are offered by You alone,
   not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
   hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
   every Contributor for any liability (excluding any
   liability arising from intellectual property claims
   relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial
   Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
   terms You offer.

   3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by
   combining Covered Code with other code not governed by
   the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
   as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
   the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
   Covered Code.

   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If
   it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
   terms of this License with respect to some or all
   of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
   or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
   terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
   and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
   file described in Section 3.4 and must be included
   with all distributions of the Source Code. Except
   to the extent  prohibited  by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently  detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   5. Application of this License. This License applies
   to code to which the Initial  Developer has attached
   the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

   6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry
   Association (the "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the License from time to time.  Each version
   will be given a distinguishing version number.

   6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been
   published under a particular version of the License,
   You may always continue to use it under the terms of
   that version. You may also choose to use such Covered
   Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
   License published by the SNIA.  No  one  other  than
   the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable
   to Covered Code created under this License.

   6.3  Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified
   version of this License (which you may only do in
   order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
   Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename
   Your license so that the phrases "Storage Networking
   Industry Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly
   similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
   to  note that your license differs from this License)
   and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the
   license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public
   License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
   Original Code or Contributor in the notice described
   in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
   modifications of this License.)

   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED
   UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
   QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
   RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
   CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE
   OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
   UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

   8.1  This  License  and  the  rights  granted
   hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
   comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
   within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the
   breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
   are properly granted shall survive any termination
   of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
   must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
   License shall survive.

   8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
   actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor
   (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
   You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
   alleging that:

   (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
   indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
   granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1
   and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
   from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
   within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:
   (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
   agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future
   use of Modifications made  by such Participant, or
   (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
   Contributor Version against such Participant. If within
   60 days  of  notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
   arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by
   the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
   the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections
   2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration
   of the 60 day notice period specified above.

   8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against
   Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
   Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
   where such claim is resolved (such as by license
   or settlement) prior  to  the  initiation of patent
   infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
   the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
   2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
   the amount or value of any payment or license.

   8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or
   8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
   distributors and resellers) which have been  validly
   granted  by  You  or any distributor hereunder prior
   to termination shall survive termination.

   9.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
   AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU,
   THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
   DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
   SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
   LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK  STOPPAGE,  COMPUTER FAILURE OR
   MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
   OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
   OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
   OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
   NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
   SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
   DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
   TO YOU.

   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a
   "commercial item," as that  term  is  defined  in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
   computer  software"  and  "commercial  computer
   software documentation," as such terms are used
   in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with
   48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
   227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
   acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth
   herein.

   11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete
   agreement concerning subject  matter hereof. If any
   provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
   such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. This License
   shall be governed by California law provisions
   (except  to  the  extent  applicable law, if any,
   provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
   provisions. The application of the United Nations
   Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
   Goods is  expressly  excluded. Any law or regulation
   which provides that the language of a contract shall
   be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
   this License.

   12.  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  CLAIMS. As between
   Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
   indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
   License and You agree to work with Initial Developer
   and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on
   an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall
   be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer
   may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that
   the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions
   of the Covered Code under Your choice of this License
   or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
   Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

   14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if
   You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code for
   any purpose.

   EXHIBIT A - The SNIA Public License.

Pegasus Library

   The Pegasus library is licensed under the terms of the
   Lesser GPL version 2.1

GNU Lesser General Public License

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away
   your freedom to share  and change it. By contrast, the
   GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
   your freedom to share and change free software--to make
   sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License,
   applies to some specially designated software
   packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
   Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
   about whether this license or the ordinary  General
   Public License is the better strategy to use in any
   particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to
   freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses
   are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
   distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish); that you receive source code or
   can get it if you want it;  that you can change the
   software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you are informed that you can do these things.

   To  protect  your  rights,  we  need  to make
   restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these
   rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you
   modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library,
   whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
   recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
   make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. If you link other code with the library, you must
   provide complete object files to the recipients, so
   that they can relink them with the library after making
   changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
   show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method:
    1. we copyright the library, and 2. we offer you this
    license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
       distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it
   very clear that there is no warranty for the free
   library. Also, if the library is modified by someone
   else and passed on, the recipients should know that
   what they have is not the original version, so that
   the original author's reputation will not be affected
   by problems that might be introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the
   existence of any free  program.  We wish to make sure
   that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of
   a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from
   a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
   license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in
   this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered
   by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This
   license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies
   to certain designated libraries, and is quite different
   from the ordinary General Public License. We use this
   license for certain libraries in order to permit linking
   those libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether
   statically or using a shared library, the combination
   of the two is legally speaking a combined work,
   a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking
   only if the entire combination fits its criteria of
   freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more
   lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

   We call this license the Lesser General Public License
   because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than
   the ordinary General Public License. It also provides
   other free software developers Less of an advantage over
   competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are
   the reason we use the ordinary General Public License
   for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
   advantages in certain special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special
   need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain
   library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To
   achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to
   use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free
   libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
   limiting  the free library to free software only,
   so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library
   in non-free programs enables a greater number of people
   to use a large body of free software. For example,
   permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs
   enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
   system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less
   protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that
   the user of a program that is linked with the Library
   has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
   using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying,
   distribution and modification follow. Pay close
   attention to the difference between a “work
   based on the library”  and a “work that uses the
   library”. The former contains code derived from the
   library, whereas the latter must be combined with the
   library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Section 0

   This License Agreement applies to any software library
   or other program which contains a notice placed by the
   copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
   Public License (also called “this License”). Each
   licensee is addressed as “you”.

   A “library” means a collection of software functions
   and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
   with application programs (which use some of those
   functions and data) to form executables.

   The “Library”, below, refers to any such software
   library or work which has been distributed under these
   terms. A “work based on the Library” means either
   the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with  modifications
   and/or  translated straightforwardly into another
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
   limitation in the term “modification”.)

   “Source code” for a work means the preferred form of
   the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
   complete source code means all the source code for
   all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition  files,  plus  the  scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and
   modification are not covered by this License; they are
   outside its scope. The act of running a program using
   the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
   program is covered  only  if  its contents constitute
   a work based on the Library (independent of the use
   of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that
   is true depends on what the Library does and what the
   program that uses the Library does.

Section 1

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
   Library's complete source code as you receive it,
   in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
   License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of
   transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
   warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

Section 2

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or
   any portion of it, thus forming  a  work  based  on  the
   Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or
   work under the terms of [3]Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a. The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
    notices stating
       that you changed the files and the date of any
       change.
    c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed
    at no charge to all
       third parties under the terms of this License.
    d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a
    function or a table of
       data to be supplied by an application program that
       uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
       when the facility is invoked, then you must  make
       a  good  faith  effort to ensure that, in the event
       an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
       (For example, a function in a library to compute
       square roots has a purpose that is entirely
       well-defined independent of the application.
       Therefore, [4]Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function  or  table used by
       this function must be optional: if the application
       does not supply it, the square root function must
       still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a
   whole. If identifiable sections  of  that  work  are
   not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
   considered independent and separate works in themselves,
   then this  License,  and its terms, do not apply to
   those sections when you distribute them as separate
   works. But when you distribute the same sections as
   part of a whole which is a work based on the Library,
   the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees
   extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
   part regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
   rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
   by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
   control the distribution of derivative or collective
   works based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
   on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on
   the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution
   medium does not bring the other work under the scope
   of this License.

Section 3

   You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU
   General Public License instead of this License to a
   given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter
   all the notices that refer to this License, so that
   they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
   version 2, instead of to this License.  (If  a newer
   version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
   Public License has appeared, then you can specify that
   version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other
   change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is
   irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
   Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
   derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of
   the code of the Library into a program that is not
   a library.

Section 4

   You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion
   or derivative of it, under [5]Section 2) in object
   code or executable form under the terms of [6]Sections
   1  and [7]2 above provided that you accompany it with
   the complete  corresponding  machine-readable  source
   code, which must be distributed under the terms of
   [8]Sections 1 and [9]2 above on a medium customarily
   used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering
   access to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent access to copy the source code from the same
   place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source
   code, even though third parties are not compelled to
   copy the source along with the object code.

Section 5

   A program that contains no derivative of any portion of
   the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by
   being compiled or linked with it, is called a “work
   that uses the Library”. Such a work, in isolation,
   is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore
   falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a “work that uses the Library”
   with the Library creates an executable that is
   a derivative of the Library (because it contains
   portions of the Library), rather than a “work that
   uses the library”. The executable is  therefore
   covered by this License. [10]Section 6 states terms
   for distribution of such executables.

   When a “work that uses the Library” uses material
   from a header file that is part of the Library, the
   object code for the work may be a derivative work of
   the Library even though the source code is not. Whether
   this is true is especially significant if the work
   can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
   itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is
   not precisely defined by law.

   If  such an object file uses only numerical parameters,
   data structure layouts and accessors, and small
   macros and small inline functions (ten lines or
   less in length), then the use of the object file is
   unrestricted, regardless  of  whether  it is legally
   a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
   code plus portions of the Library will still fall under
   [11]Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library,
   you may distribute the  object  code  for  the work
   under the terms of [12]Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under [13]Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the
   Library itself.

Section 6

   As an exception to the Sections above, you may also
   combine or link a “work that  uses  the Library”
   with the Library to produce a work containing portions
   of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of
   your choice, provided that the terms permit modification
   of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of
   the work that the Library is used in it and that
   the Library and its use are covered by this License.
   You  must  supply a copy of this License. If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must
   include the copyright notice for the Library among them,
   as well as a reference directing the user to the copy
   of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
    a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable
       source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be
       distributed under [14]Sections 1 and [15]2 above);
       and, if the work is an executable linked with
       the Library, with the complete machine-readable
       “work that uses the Library”, as object code
       and/or source code, so that the user can modify
       the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.
       (It is understood that the user who changes the
       contents of definitions files in the Library will
       not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
    b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
    with the Library. A
       suitable  mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
       time a copy of the library already present on the
       user's computer system, rather than copying library
       functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
       properly with a modified version of the library,
       if the user installs one, as long as the modified
       version is interface-compatible with the version
       that the work was made with.
    c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for
    at least three years,
       to give the same user the materials specified in
       [16]Subsection 6a, above,  for  a  charge  no  more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.
    d. If distribution of the work is made by offering
    access to copy from a
       designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
       the above specified materials from the same place.
    e. Verify that the user has already received a copy
    of these materials or
       that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the “work
   that uses the Library” must  include any data and
   utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
   from it. However, as a special exception, the materials
   to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
   with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
   of the operating system on which the executable runs,
   unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
   license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
   do not normally accompany the operating system. Such
   a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
   Library together in an executable that you distribute.

Section 7

   You  may place library facilities that are a work
   based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
   together with other library facilities not covered by
   this License, and distribute such a combined library,
   provided that the separate distribution of the work
   based on the Library and of the other library facilities
   is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
   two things:
    a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the
    same work based on the
       Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities. This must be distributed under the
       terms of the Sections above.
    b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of
    the fact that part of
       it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of
       the same work.

Section 8

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will  automatically terminate your rights
   under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

Section 9

   You are not required to accept this License, since you
   have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you
   permission to modify or distribute the Library or its
   derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
   you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying
   or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this  License
   to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based
   on it.

Section 10

   Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work
   based on the Library), the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
   distribute, link with or modify the Library subject
   to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
   further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
   the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
   enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

Section 11

   If,  as  a  consequence  of  a  court judgment or
   allegation of patent infringement  or  for any other
   reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions  are
   imposed  on you (whether by court order, agreement
   or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
   License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
   of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
   satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as
   a consequence you may not distribute the  Library at
   all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
   who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
   then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
   of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or
   unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
   the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
   infringe any patents or other property right claims or
   to contest validity of any such claims; this section
   has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
   the free software  distribution  system  which is
   implemented by public license practices. Many people
   have made generous contributions to the wide range
   of software  distributed  through  that  system in
   reliance on consistent application of that system;
   it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she
   is  willing to distribute software through any other
   system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear
   what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
   this License.

Section 12

   If the distribution and/or use of the Library is
   restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
   copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright  holder
   who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
   those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
   in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case,
   this License incorporates the limitation as if written
   in the body of this License.

Section 13

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
   new versions of the Lesser General Public License from
   time to time. Such new versions will be similar  in
   spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
   to address new problems or concerns.

   Each  version is given a distinguishing version
   number. If the Library specifies a version number
   of this License which applies to it and “any later
   version”, you have the option of following the terms
   and conditions either  of  that version or of any later
   version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
   the Library does not specify a license version number,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free
   Software Foundation.

Section 14

   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into
   other free programs whose distribution conditions are
   incompatible with these, write to the author to ask
   for permission. For software which is copyrighted
   by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
   this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
   free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
   of software generally.

NO WARRANTY Section 15

   BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
   NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
   THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
   LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
   A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
   AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
   LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

Section 16

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
   AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
   ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
   THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
   DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
   OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
   TO LOSS OF DATA OR  DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
   LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
   OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
   THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of
   the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
   making it free software that everyone can redistribute
   and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
   under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
   of the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to
   the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
   of each source file to most effectively convey the
   exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
   least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where
   the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea
   of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

   This library is free software; you can redistribute
   it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License as published by the Free Software
   Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will
   be useful, but WITHOUT ANY  WARRANTY; without even the
   implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
   License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License along with this library; if not,
   write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
   Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic
   and paper mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as
   a programmer) or your school,  if  any, to sign
   a “copyright disclaimer” for the library, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
   in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs)
   written by James Random Hacker.

   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President
   of Vice

   That's all there is to it!

                               Preamble
   
     The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
   software and other kinds of works.
   
     The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
   to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
   the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
   share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
   software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
   GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
   any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
   your programs, too.
   
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
   free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
   
     To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
   these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
   certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
   you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
   
     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
   gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
   freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
   or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
   know their rights.
   
     Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
   (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
   giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
   
     For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
   that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
   authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
   changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
   authors of previous versions.
   
     Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
   modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
   can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
   protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
   pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
   use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
   have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
   products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
   stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
   of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
   
     Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
   software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
   avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
   make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
   patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
   
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.
   
                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
     0. Definitions.
   
     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
   
     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.
   
     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
   
     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
   
     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.
   
     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.
   
     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
   
     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
   
     1. Source Code.
   
     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.
   
     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.
   
     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
   
     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
   work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.
   
     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
   Source.
   
     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
   same work.
   
     2. Basic Permissions.
   
     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
   
     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
   
     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
   makes it unnecessary.
   
     3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
   
     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.
   
     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.
   
     4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
   
     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
   
     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
   
     5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
   
     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
   
       a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
       it, and giving a relevant date.
   
       b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
       released under this License and any conditions added under section
       7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
       "keep intact all notices".
   
       c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
       License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
       additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
       regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
       permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
       invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
   
       d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
       work need not make them do so.
   
     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
   works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
   and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
   in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
   "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
   used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
   beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
   in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
   parts of the aggregate.
   
     6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
   
     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
   in one of these ways:
   
       a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
       customarily used for software interchange.
   
       b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
       model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
       copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
       medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
       conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
       Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
   
       c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
       alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
       only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
       with subsection 6b.
   
       d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
       Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
       further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
       Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
       may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
       clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
       Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
       available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
   
       e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
       Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
       charge under subsection 6d.
   
     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
   from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
   included in conveying the object code work.
   
     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
   or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
   into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
   doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
   product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
   typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
   of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
   actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
   is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
   commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
   the only significant mode of use of the product.
   
     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
   and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
   a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
   suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
   code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
   modification has been made.
   
     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
   part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
   User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
   fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
   Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
   by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
   if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
   modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
   been installed in ROM).
   
     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
   for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
   the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
   network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
   adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
   protocols for communication across the network.
   
     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
   in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
   documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
   source code form), and must require no special password or key for
   unpacking, reading or copying.
   
     7. Additional Terms.
   
     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.
   
     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
   removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
   
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
   that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
   
       a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
       terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
   
       b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
       author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
       Notices displayed by works containing it; or
   
       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
   
       d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
       authors of the material; or
   
       e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
       trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
   
       f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
       material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
       any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
       those licensors and authors.
   
     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
   governed by this License along with a term that is a further
   restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
   a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
   License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
   of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
   not survive such relicensing or conveying.
   
     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
   must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
   additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
   where to find the applicable terms.
   
     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
   form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
   the above requirements apply either way.
   
     8. Termination.
   
     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
   paragraph of section 11).
   
     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
   prior to 60 days after the cessation.
   
     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
   your receipt of the notice.
   
     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.
   
     9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
   
     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
   
     10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
   
     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
   
     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
   
     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
   
     11. Patents.
   
     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
   
     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
   this License.
   
     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.
   
     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
   sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
   patent against the party.
   
     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
   country that you have reason to believe are valid.
   
     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
   work and works based on it.
   
     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
   
     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
   
     12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
   
     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
   
     13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
   
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
   but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
   section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
   combination as such.
   
     14. Revised Versions of this License.
   
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.
   
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
   version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
   GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
   by the Free Software Foundation.
   
     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
   versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
   to choose that version for the Program.
   
     Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
   later version.
   
     15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   
     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   
     16. Limitation of Liability.
   
     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.
   
     17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
   
     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
   copy of the Program in return for a fee.
   
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
   
     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
   
     To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
   to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
   state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
   the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
   
       <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
       Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
   
       This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
       it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
       the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
       (at your option) any later version.
   
       This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
       GNU General Public License for more details.
   
       You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
       along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
   
   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
   
     If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
   notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
   
       <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
       This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
       This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
       under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
   
   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
   parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
   might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
   
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
   if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
   For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
   <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
   
     The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
   into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
   may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
   the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
   Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
   <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

         2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
   
   
         The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:
               (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than
               patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
               modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or
               portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger
               Work; and
   
               (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
               of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for
               sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).
                             
   
               (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
               on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the
               terms of this License.
   
               (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
               granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate
               from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the
               modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original
               Code with other software or devices.
   
                
   
         2.2. Contributor Grant.
   
         Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
         hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
                
   
               (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than
               patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
               display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by
               such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with
               other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
   
               (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
               of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
               combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination),
               to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose
               of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and
               2) the combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with
               its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
   
               (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
               on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
   
               (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no
               patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted
               from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor
               Version; 
               3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
               Contributor
               Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor
               with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or
               other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
               absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
   
   
   3. Distribution Obligations.
   
         3.1. Application of License.
   
         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
         by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
         The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
         terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
         Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
         copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
         terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
         version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
         may include an additional document offering the additional rights described
         in Section 3.5.
   
         3.2. Availability of Source Code.
   
         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
         on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
         available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
         must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
         initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
         version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
         recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
         remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
         by a third party.
   
         3.3. Description of Modifications.
   
         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
         a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
         Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided
         by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer
         in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
         or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
         of the Covered Code.
   
         3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
               (a) Third Party Claims.
   
               If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
               intellectual
               property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
               under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
               Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
               the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
               whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification
               is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
               modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter
               and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists
               or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
               Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
   
               (b) Contributor APIs.
   
               If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
               and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
               to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in
               the LEGAL file.
   
                
   
                   (c)   
         Representations.
               Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
               3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
               Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
               to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
   
   
         3.5. Required Notices.
   
         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
         Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
         Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice
         in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
         A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
         to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
         on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
         Contributor.
   
         You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity
         or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
         indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
         incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
   
         3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
   
         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
         of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
         include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code
         is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
         how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.
         The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
         version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
         rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
         version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
         which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
         are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
         the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
         If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
         must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
         are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
         You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
         for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
         as a result of any such terms You offer.
   
         3.7. Larger Works.
   
         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
         as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
         of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
   
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
   
         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
         judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
         of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
   
         and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
         file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions
   
         of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
         such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
         skill to be able to understand it.
   
   5. Application of this License.
   
         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
         the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
   
   6. Versions of the License.
   
         6.1. New Versions.
   
         Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised
         and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
         be given a distinguishing version number.
   
         6.2. Effect of New Versions.
   
         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
         the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
         any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
         than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
         created under this License.
   
         6.3. Derivative Works.
   
         If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
         may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
         governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
         phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL''
         or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
         to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
         make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
         from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in
         the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
         notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed
         to be modifications of this License.)
   
   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
   
         COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
         WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
         LIMITATION,
         WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
         AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE
         PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
         CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.
         NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
         DISCLAIMER.
   
   8. TERMINATION.
   
         8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
         terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
         to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
         any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
         remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
   
         8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
         infringement
         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
         or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
         file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
   
         (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
         upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
         within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing
         to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
         and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw
         Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
         Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
         payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties
         or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant
         to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration
         of the 60 day notice period specified above.
   
         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such
         Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
         patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
         2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made,
         used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
   
         8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against
         Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
         or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
         litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
         Participant
         under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
         amount or value of any payment or license.
   
         8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or
         8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
         and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
         hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
   
   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   
         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
         NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
         ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
         OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
         INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
         LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
         OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
         IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
         THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
         PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
         LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
         OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
         AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
   
   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
   
         The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined
         in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software''
         and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used
         in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
         48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
         End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
   
   11. MISCELLANEOUS.
   
         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
         hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
         provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
   
         This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
         the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
         conflict-of-law
         provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
         of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States
         of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
         the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California,
         with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
         responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable
         attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
         on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
         Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
         be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
   
   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
   
         As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
   
         for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
         of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer
         and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
         Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
         of liability.
   
   13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
   
         Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
         Multiple-Licensed. 
         Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize
         portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative
         licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described
         in Exhibit A.

   University, University of California, Irvine, and

   available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and 
   distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software 
   source code and object code produced from the source, as 
   well as copy and distribute modified versions of this 
   software. You must, however, include this copyright 
   statement along with any code built using DOC software that 
   you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if 
   you just ship binary executables of your software products.
   
   You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary 
   software releases and are under no obligation to 
   redistribute any of your source code that is built using 
   DOC software. Note, however, that you may not 
   misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting 
   it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software 
   code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being 
   distributed freely using an open-source development model. 
   You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in 
   your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we 
   can promote your project in the DOC software success 
   stories.
   
   The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are 
   maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for Software 
   Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed 
   Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for 
   the development of open-source software as part of the 
   open-source software community. Submissions are provided by 
   the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever, 
   including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement 
   of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any 
   particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be 
   liable for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, 
   punitive, or consequential damages, including without 
   limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the 
   possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is 
   provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including 
   the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for 
   a particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a 
   course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington 
   University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their 
   employees, and students shall have no liability with 
   respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or 
   any patents by DOC software or any part thereof. Moreover, 
   in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or 
   Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be 
   liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, 
   indirect and consequential damages.
   
   DOC software is provided with no support and without any 
   obligation on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, 
   Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to 
   assist in its use, correction, modification, or 
   enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide 
   commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software 
   is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is 
   Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the 
   new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The 
   Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new daylight 
   savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand 
   DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date 
   and calendaring information from operating systems users 
   will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they 
   upgrade their operating systems accordingly.
   
   The names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM),

2.4  GLX Public License

GLX PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 1.0 (2/11/99)) ("License")

Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI") hereby
grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under Recipient's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge, pub-
lish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software (defined
below), and to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is furnished in
accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of the following
terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging in any such use,
copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing or sell-
ing:

1. Definitions.

     (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer software code
     which is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

     (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
     stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
     Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
     files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
     the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous
     Modifications and (ii) any new file that contains any part of the
     Original Code or previous Modifications.

     (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications
     or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or
     portions of any of the foregoing.

     (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
     rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
     For legal entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which controls,
     is controlled by, or is under common control with Recipient. For
     purposes of this definition, "control" of an entity means (a) the
     power, direct or indirect, to direct or manage such entity, or (b)
     ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares
     or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. Redistributions of
Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in
Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in
any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights
relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the
source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
(i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13
of this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under
a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as
a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes
the user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute
the executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
(i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable version under
a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as
a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to
the OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to
any other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original Soft-
ware at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software not
expressly granted under this License are reserved.

7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
(directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
deemed to have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality
or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intel-
lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description
of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon
gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
include the URL for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sec-
tions 2 and 3, above, and in the text of any related documentation, license
agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relat-
ing to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it
makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or news-
groups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject Soft-
ware that new knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SER-
VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THE-
ORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIA-
BILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.
from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including
the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of
any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S.  Government End
Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to
the terms of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
forceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as
possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within California between California residents. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter
jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with
venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a con-
tract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

CID FONT CODE PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 1.0 (3/31/99))("License")

Subject to any applicable third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI")
hereby grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under SGI's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge, pub-
lish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software (defined
below) in both source code and executable form, and to permit persons to whom
the Subject Software is furnished in accordance with this License to do the
same, subject to all of the following terms and conditions, which Recipient
accepts by engaging in any such use, copying, modifying, merging, publica-
tion, distributing, sublicensing or selling:

1. Definitions.

     a. "Original Software" means source code of computer software code
     that is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

     b. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
     stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
     Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
     files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
     the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous
     Modifications and (ii) any new file that contains any part of the
     Original Code or previous Modifications.

     c. "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications
     or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or
     portions of any of the foregoing.

     d. "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
     rights under the terms of this License. For legal entities, "Recip-
     ient" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
     under common control with Recipient. For purposes of this defini-
     tion, "control" of an entity means (i) the power, direct or indi-
     rect, to direct or manage such entity, or (ii) ownership of fifty
     percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial own-
     ership of such entity.

     e. "Required Notice" means the notice set forth in Exhibit A to
     this License.

     f. "Accompanying Technology" means any software or other technology
     that is not a Modification and that is distributed or made publicly
     available by Recipient with the Subject Software.  Separate soft-
     ware files that do not contain any Original Software or any previ-
     ous Modification shall not be deemed a Modification, even if such
     software files are aggregated as part of a product, or in any
     medium of storage, with any file that does contain Original Soft-
     ware or any previous Modification.

2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software must be made sub-
ject to the terms of this License. A copy of this License and the Required
Notice must be included in any documentation for Subject Software where
Recipient's rights relating to Subject Software and/or any Accompanying Tech-
nology are described. Distributions of Subject Software in source code form
must also include the Required Notice in every file distributed. In addition,
a ReadMe file entitled "Important Legal Notice" must be distributed with each
distribution of one or more files that incorporate Subject Software. That
file must be included with distributions made in both source code and exe-
cutable form. A copy of the License and the Required Notice must be included
in that file.  Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under a
license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this
License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this
License, (ii) such other license terms do not modify or supersede the terms
of this License as applicable to the Subject Software, (iii) Recipient hereby
indemnifies SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of the distri-
bution of Accompanying Technology or the use of other license terms.

3. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

4. Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any trade
name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or ser-
vice mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from or
incorporating any Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

5. No Other Rights. No rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder
shall arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise. Title to and ownership of
the Original Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Origi-
nal Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
(directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
other person or entity, or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
deemed to have been distributed.

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality
or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intel-
lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description
of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon
gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
include the URL for such web page in the Required Notice, and in the text of
any related documentation, license agreement or collateral in which Recipient
describes end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If Recipient
obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other
person or entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appro-
priate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to provide such
knowledge to those who received the Subject Software.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SER-
VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE OR
THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT TO THE EXTENT SO DISALLOWED.

10. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold SGI and its successors and assigns
harmless from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses
(including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of (Recipi-
ent's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Soft-
ware or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

11. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S. Government End Users
acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the
terms of this License.

12. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
forceable by any judicial or administrative authority having proper jurisdic-
tion with respect thereto, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve
as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision and
the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States
and the State of California as applied to agreements entered into and to be
performed entirely within California between California residents. Any liti-
gation relating to this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdic-
tion of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent
subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of Cali-
fornia), with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with
the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of
a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
License.

    intellectual property protections inherent in the Original Code, SGI
    hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, to do the following: (i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI,
    to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, and, to the
    extent applicable, display and perform the Original Code and/or any
    Modifications provided by SGI alone and/or as part of a Larger Work;
    and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
    and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. Recipient accepts the terms
    and conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned
    actions. The patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the
    time any related Modification is added, such addition of the
    Modification causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
    Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any
    other combinations that include the Modification.  No patent license is
    provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by
    Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code and
    Modifications not provided by SGI.

    2.2. Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and
    any third party intellectual property claims, Recipient hereby grants
    SGI and any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, under any Recipient Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
    and/or any Modifications provided by SGI.

    2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in
    Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of

    provided by SGI .

3. Redistributions.

    3.1. Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in
    Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and
    all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered
    Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can
    include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a
    copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral
    where the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.
    Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original
    Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions
    of Covered Code.

    3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with
    the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation
    of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the
    source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this
    License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such
    changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as
    licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's
    choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that
    the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
    and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
    terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other
    than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of
    its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient
    alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited
    license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
    accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such
    rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually
    been granted by SGI in this License.

    3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
    liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license
    terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code
that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License,
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
(i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark
or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right
for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the
Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title
to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with

control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and
other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered
Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any
intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or
(ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have
been subject.

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under
the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS
AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI
ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT SUBJECT TO THIS DISCLAIMER.

ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,

INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
RECIPIENT.

directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon
Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out
of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the
Covered Code or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item"

Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning the its subject matter. If any provision of this License is held
to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as
nearly as possible the same legal and economic effect as the original
provision and the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This
License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the United States and the State of California as applied to agreements
entered into and to be performed entirely within California between
California residents. Any litigation relating to this License shall be

reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

Python 2.2

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (see
http://www.digicool.com).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation
(PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit
organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual
Property.  Digital Creations is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
        from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        no
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.2             2.1.1       2001        PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

PyCrypto

Previously, the copyright and/or licensing status of the Python
Cryptography Toolkit ("PyCrypto") had been somewhat ambiguous.  The
original intention of Andrew M. Kuchling and other contributors has
been to dedicate PyCrypto to the public domain, but that intention was
not necessarily made clear in the original disclaimer (see
LEGAL/copy/LICENSE.orig).

Additionally, some files within PyCrypto had specified their own
licenses that differed from the PyCrypto license itself.  For example,
the original RIPEMD.c module simply had a copyright statement and
warranty disclaimer, without clearly specifying any license terms.
(An updated version on the author's website came with a license that
contained a GPL-incompatible advertising clause.)

To rectify this situation for PyCrypto 2.1, the following steps have
been taken:

 1. Obtaining explicit permission from the original contributors to
    dedicate their contributions to the public domain if they have not
    already done so.  (See the "LEGAL/copy/stmts" directory for
    contributors' statements.)

 2. Replacing some modules with clearly-licensed code from other
    sources (e.g. the DES and DES3 modules were replaced with new ones
    based on Tom St. Denis's public-domain LibTomCrypt library.)

 3. Replacing some modules with code written from scratch (e.g. the
    RIPEMD and Blowfish modules were re-implemented from their
    respective algorithm specifications without reference to the old
    implementations).

 4. Removing some modules altogether without replacing them.

To the best of our knowledge, with the exceptions noted below or
within the files themselves, the files that constitute PyCrypto are in
the public domain.  Most are distributed with the following notice:

  The contents of this file are dedicated to the public domain.  To
  the extent that dedication to the public domain is not available,
  everyone is granted a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license to exercise all rights associated with the
  contents of this file for any purpose whatsoever.
  No rights are reserved.

  ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN

Exceptions:

 - Portions of HMAC.py and setup.py are derived from Python 2.2, and

   Foundation (All Rights Reserved).  They are licensed by the PSF
   under the terms of the Python 2.2 license.  (See the file
   LEGAL/copy/LICENSE.python-2.2 for details.)

 - The various GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, aclocal, etc.) are
   used during the build process.  This includes macros from
   autoconf-archive, which are located in the m4/ directory.  As is
   customary, some files from the GNU autotools are included in the
   source tree (in the root directory, and in the build-aux/
   directory).  These files are merely part of the build process, and
   are not included in binary builds of the software.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS:

Note that the export or re-export of cryptographic software and/or
